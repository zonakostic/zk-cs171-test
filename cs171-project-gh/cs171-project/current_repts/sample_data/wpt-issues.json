However, you'll see that there's not just 1 but 5 flavors of each test file, as I'm not sure which approach is the most desired:  \r\n\r\n- the \"dummies\" approach which I saw in existing tests (the \"untested\" IDL is a bare skeleton)  (-->  ~50 tests / file)\r\n\r\n- the \"full IDL\" approach, in which the \"untested\" IDL contains all the background WebIDL to support the \"tested\" IDL  (-->  ~1500 tests / file)\r\n\r\n- the \"all tested\" approach, in which *all* the IDL is tested along with the object(s), because, as was recently written on the list, chugging through many / redundant tests is cheap, so \"why not\".  (-->  ~2000 tests / file)\r\n\r\n- the \"prevent multiple\" approach, by which many interfaces can be just tested once within each file.  This may be contrary to the \"why not\" approach, but the API exists, so here it is being used (although separate test files still duplicate tests)  (--> ~250 tests / file)\r\n\r\n- the \"prevent multiple but test all IDL\" approach, which is perhaps an odd compromise but aims to maximize the number of unique tests performed.  (-->  ~850 tests / file)\r\n\r\nI'll be curious to see which one you cherry pick to include in the test suite (if any).  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any

Wobensmith, SQA Engineer at Mozilla did an awesomesauce review, that I have not fixed (originally from #112 ):\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n- CORS can be used for other network requests besides XHR\r\n     - img, script, css, fonts\r\n- Cross-protocol - access a resource that is hosted via protocol that provides headers\r\n     - FTP, HTTP, HTTPS to HTTP, HTTPS - various combinations\r\n \r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin response header\r\n- Simple request: when using \"*\" it cannot be used for a resource that supports credentials\r\n- Boundary/error values: long domain names, large amount of domain tokens, IP addresses, International Domain Names\r\n- Default request method for cross-origin request is GET\r\n- Default request headers empty by default.\r\n- Default entity body empty by default\r\n- Exclude Referer header if source origin is a globally unique identifier\r\n- if header value is \"*\" and omit credentials flag is false, fail\r\n \r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods\r\n- if request method is not case-sensitive match for methods and is not a simple method, error\r\n- If method is a simple method, including method value here - while not required - should not fail\r\n \r\nOrigin Request header\r\n- Verify that it is emitted from both x-domain request and preflight request\r\n \r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials\r\n- If omit-credentials flag is not set and response includes 0 or more than one Access-Control-Allow-Credentials headers, fail.\r\n- If omit-credentials flag is not set and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header value is not case-sensitive match for \"true\", fail.\r\n \r\nPreflight:\r\n- Includes Access-Control-Request-Method header that includes the request method, even when this is a simple method\r\n- Includes Access-Control-Request-Headers with comma-seperated list of headers, in lexographical order, converted to ASCII lowercase even when one or more are a simple header\r\n- excludes author request headers\r\n- excludes user credentials\r\n- excludes the request entity body\r\n- if header parsing fails, error\r\n- in case of unable to cache due to disk space - proceed to actual request\r\n \r\nPreflight cache:\r\n- Case-insensitive match for Origin invalidates preflight result cache\r\n- Access-Control-Max-Age - validate correct caching time\r\n- Access-Control-Max-Age - maximum cache time\r\n- Access-Control-Max-Age - error arguments (too large, too small, non-numeric)\r\n- Access-Control-Max-Age - if UA imposes high-end limit but response's max-age is higher, let maximum be equal to the response's max-age\r\n- If Access-Control-Max-Age is missing, duplicated or parsing failed, let max-age be at the discretion of UA (zero is allowed)\r\n \r\n- Cache match testing\r\n     - Based on rules in spec, determine whether a resource is properly cached or not\r\n     - Verify that an expired resource no longer in cache invokes new preflight request\r\n     - If removed and then reinstated into cache, new values should be respected\r\n     - Origin is removed from cache if error occurs     \r\n     - If list of exposed headers in a response is not empty, and Access-Control-Expose-Headers does not contain values, the preflight cache can be cleared for all case-sensitive matches to this Origin and URL."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/315","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/315","id":18800340,"number":315,"title":"Add

Here is comment #1 but note there are additional comments in the bug:\r\n\r\n[[\r\n<https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24077>\r\n\r\nThe test has:\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    postMessage(1, null);\r\n  } catch(e) {\r\n    postMessage(''+e);\r\n  }\r\n\r\nand asserts that 1 is posted.\r\n\r\nBut the spec for postMessage is:\r\n\r\n  void postMessage(any message, optional sequence<Transferable> transfer);\r\n\r\nand passing null to the second argument of that should throw, per webidl.\r\n\r\nI recommend we do three things:\r\n\r\n1)  Add a copy of this test that replaces the first postMessage line with:\r\n\r\n     postMessage(1);\r\n\r\n2)  Add a copy of this test that replaces the first postMessage line with:\r\n\r\n     postMessage(1, undefined);\r\n\r\n3)  Modify this test to check that postMessage(1, null) in fact throws.\r\n\r\n#1 and #2 would test correct handling of the optional argument when it's not actually passed and #3 would test correct

might be useful to you folks:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/0c92f20d2a458c016fa82cd8742d15262770d563/test/living-dom/attributes.js\r\n\r\nI unfortunately don't have the bandwidth currently to convert these into WPT format, but I thought it'd be cool to make you aware of it in case someone does want to take this on.

it might be treated as the empty string instead.)\r\n\r\nThis means that a server may believe there is a message-body, due to the presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding, but this does not mean that a message-body was actually transmitted.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if Content-Length is 0, then the message-body has both an entity length and transfer length of 0, which one should take to mean that no request body was actually included in the request.\r\n\r\n...Unless I'm misunderstanding the RFC entirely, but I don't think there is anything there which says a user-agent MUST NOT send a

according to section boundaries,\r\n3. generates a stub entry for each section that appears to be testable (heuristics are very basic atm),\r\n4. identifies webIDL blocks,\r\n5. generates idlharness tests for each of those (evens comes up with credible interfaces for missing dependencies using [webidl-deps](https://github.com/tobie/webidl-deps)].\r\n\r\nNext steps which are near ready, but some are slightly invasive so wanted to discuss before:\r\n\r\n1. prompt mode which simplifies choosing which section is testable and which isn't,\r\n2. auto-open and tag issues for each section (great for distributing work),\r\n3. handles spec changes by opening up issues for each section that has been modified since a test was

adds some tests that suggest that (after percent-decoding and Nameprep) the URL parser should convert hexadecimal and octal numbers in IPv4 addresses to decimal, support less than four dot-separated pieces, and check that they’re within range:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://%30%78%63%30%2e%30%32%35%30.01 s:http p:/ h:127.0.0.1\r\nhttp://\\uff10\\uff38\\uff43\\uff10\\uff0e\\uff10\\uff12\\uff15\\uff10\\uff0e\\uff10\\uff11  s:http p:/ h:192.168.0.1\r\nhttp://192.168.0.257\r\n```\r\n\r\n(By the way, it looks like the first line should have `h:192.168.0.1` instead of `h:127.0.0.1`. The first two inputs decode to `http://0xc0.0250.01`.)\r\n\r\nBut I find nothing in the spec that supports this. Should it be added to the spec, or should these tests be removed?\r\n\r\nFor what it’s worth, [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-7.4) says:\r\n> For example, many implementations allow dotted forms of three numbers, wherein the last part is interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right-most two bytes of the network address (e.g., a Class B network).  Likewise, a dotted form of two numbers means that the last part is interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right-most three bytes of the network address (Class A), and a single number (without dots) is interpreted as a 32-bit quantity and stored directly in the network address. Adding further to the confusion, some implementations allow each dotted part to be interpreted as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as specified in the C language (i.e., a leading 0x or 0X implies hexadecimal; a leading 0 implies octal; otherwise, the number is interpreted as decimal).\r\n>\r\n> These additional IP address formats are not allowed in the URI syntax due to differences between platform implementations.  However, they can become a security concern if an application attempts to filter access to resources based on the IP address in string literal format. If this filtering is performed, literals should be converted to numeric form and filtered based on the numeric value, and not on a prefix or suffix of the string form.\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/\">Decimal</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://0x7f.0.0.1:8000/\">Hex</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://0177.0.0.1:8000/\">Octal</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirefox and Chrome both connect to localhost for all three links. Firefox considers all links different for the purpose of applying `:visited` styling and displays them as-is in the address bar, while Chrome considers them all the same and displays the decimal version in the address bar.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth having in the spec a concept of IPv4 address made of four 8-bit pieces (just like IPv6 address is a separate concept) instead of treating them as string domains.\r\n\r\nCC @annevk @sideshowbarker "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1105","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1105","id":37766262,"number":1105,"title":"Removed some Workers IDL tests.

Results\r\n==================\r\n\r\n/XMLHttpRequest/xmlhttprequest-timeout-worker-overrides.html\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFAIL Timeout test: timeout enabled after initially disabled, original timeout at 0, reset at 400 to 1000\r\n15:30.92 LOG: MainThread INFO Closing logging queue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that the response is delivered at ~0.6s while the timeout is reset at 0.4s from 0 to 1s. However, sometimes both the response and timeout reset happen very close to 1s (possibly due to the OS scheduling). When this happens, because the time since the fetch started is 1s and the request has not yet completed, we endup with a \"timeout\" event rather than \"load\". \r\n\r\nOne possible solution I could think of was to change the test so that when we reset the timeout value, we reset it to some value >>1000ms, giving plenty of time for the request to complete."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1363","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1363/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1363/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1363/events","html_url":"https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1363","id":47944628,"number":1363,"title":"Fix

noticed the following problems with isTypeSupported tests. Don't know if/how to report that using Critic.\r\n\r\n\"Test invalid MIME format\"\r\nhttps://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/master/media-source/mediasource-is-type-supported.html#L23-L33\r\n- I don't understand why this subtest uses \"webm\" as MIME sub-type. The tests should be (or at least include subtests that are) independent of the byte stream format to demonstrate how the method works. It could work on an hypothetical video/x-my-video format. \r\n- the test misses testing syntactical valid values that are clearly unsupported such as video/x-my-video or audio/x-my-audio, or text/plain or application/octet-stream ...\r\n\r\n\"Test invalid mismatch between major type and codec ID\"\r\nhttps://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/master/media-source/mediasource-is-type-supported.html#L35-L38\r\nThe term \"codec ID\" should be replaced by \"codecs parameter\".\r\nThe notion of \"mismatch\" is not defined in the spec. This is related to the MIME types of the associated segment formats. It's not really up to MSE to test that. If we wanted to test that, there are many more tests to be added: for instance, it misses text tracks and associated mismatch. I suggest removing this subtest.\r\n\r\n\"Test invalid mismatch between minor type and codec ID\"\r\nSame remark for \"codec ID\" and the definition of \"mismatch\".\r\nThere are people working on the carriage of opus in mp4 so the notion of mismatch is moving. Similarly, 'audio/mp4;codecs=\"vorbis\"' might be valid in the future. The question is why test such mismatch? The MIME type is not invalid. It may not be supported by an implementation but that's not a spec test. I suggest removing this subtest.\r\n\r\n\"Test invalid codec ID\"\r\nSame remark as above for the term \"codec ID\"\r\nBut this subtest is more a test for the ISOBMFF byte stream specification than for MSE. We could move them to a is-type-supported-isobmff.html test.\r\nA side question is: how can a Web app test for a class of codecs, such as all \"avc1\" configurations.\r\n\r\n\"Test valid MP4 type\"\r\nAgain these subtests are more related to the testing of the ISOBMFF spec than the MSE spec. There are many more codecs value that could be tested: \"wvtt\" for WebVTT in MP4, \"stpp\" for XML subtitles, \"tx3g\" for 3GPP timed text, ... and all formats defined at http://www.mp4ra.org/codecs\r\n\r\nAlso these tests don't test:\r\n- call with more than 2 values in codecs: all unsupported, all but one supported, audio+video+text, ...\r\n- call with a null argument (throws an exception)\r\n- call with no argument (throws an exception)\r\n- call with type is empty string (returns false)\r\n\r\nI can prepare a PR with the agreeable changes if needed."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1387","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1387/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1387/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1387/events","html_url":"https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1387","id":48910757,"number":1387,"title":"Update

instructions at the top of the browser-based runner page take up a lot of vertical space and only really need to be shown to users when the page first loads. So this PR moves the instructions to follow the runner (form) controls. After the user starts a test run, the instructions are hidden and just the progress/results are then shown after the runner controls. This seems like better UX to me than showing the instructions all the time.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR adds some simple background-color animation to the \"updating and loading test manifest\" text so that the user knows the runner isn't just hanging. That's to address https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/1372.
